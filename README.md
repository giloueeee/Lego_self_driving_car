Development of an end-to-end system that enables autonomous driving of a miniature car through real-time analysis of the vehicle's front-facing video feed by a neural network.
<br/><br/>
The autonomous driving is integrated into a complex system that includes a real-time route mapping system, a navigation system, and a voice control system. All of this is controllable via a mobile application.
